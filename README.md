# HacktoberFest Starter Project

Use this project to make your first contribution to an open source project on GitHub. Practice making your first pull request to a public repository before doing the real thing!

Celebrate [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) by getting involved in the open source community by completing some simple tasks in this project.

This repository is open to all members of the GitHub community. Any member may contribute to this project without being a collaborator.

## What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate.

Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects. As long as the project is public and GitHub-hosted, your pull requests will count toward your participation.

You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

## Participation rules
To get a shirt, you must make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1–31 in any time zone. Pull requests can be to any public repository on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 75,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.
